Advent of Code
==============

This repository is an overview of my personal [Advent of Code (AoC)][aoc-site] solutions, which
are given in [python][python-site].

About AoC
---------
[AoC][aoc-about] is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles
for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any
programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training,
university coursework, practice problems, a speed contents, or to challenge each other.
Each year it starts on the 1st of December, releasing a new puzzle every day divided in
two parts (the second part is only unlocked after solving the first one). It is created by
[Eric Wastl][aoc-eric] and it is free, but if you want to support its creator, you can donate to him
here [here][aoc-support].
