🧠 About AoC
------------
[AoC][aoc-about] is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles
for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any
programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training,
university coursework, practice problems, a speed contents, or to challenge each other.
Each year it starts on the 1st of December, releasing a new puzzle every day divided in
two parts (the second part is only unlocked after solving the first one). It is created by
[Eric Wastl][aoc-eric] and it is free, but if you want to support its creator, you can donate to him [here][aoc-support].

📋 Personal Rules
-----------------
To keep the challenge authentic and enjoyable, I follow a few personal rules while solving the Advent of Code puzzles:
1. **No looking up answers**:
   - Always solve the puzzles independently.
2. **References only when necessary**:
   - May only look up documentation (e.g. algorithms) if I cannot recall some details by heart.
   - Or *after* solving a puzzle to see whether my approach could be improved (this will be mentioned).
3. **Minimize imports**: 
   - The real goal is to write solutions that are as close to library-less as possible.
   - If really needed, I only allow myself to use the [Python standard library][py-standard].
4. **Elegant one-liners**: 
   - Not really a rule, but I enjoy finding clean, compact one-liners. Mostly for reading/structuring the input.
